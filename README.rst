afraid
------

This is a simple & extensible command-line client for the dynamic DNS service
offered by `afraid.org <http://freedns.afraid.org/>`_. It will retrieve the set
of hostnames associated with a particular account and update their records at
a user-specifiable regular interval.

The development version is available at `GitHub
<https://github.com/atdt/afraid>`_. Issues should be documented
there.
